## Frontend course project

This folder is reserved for the **complete reference project** for `fs-course-frontend`.

- Use it as a target structure for a production-quality Next.js app.
- You can also keep your own final app here as you complete lessons and exercises.

Start with the lessons in `level-01-nextjs-basics/` and build forward.
